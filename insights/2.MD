They  call it 'personal' finance for a reason

Your goals, your money, your  future

You know your family's needs best, so take the time to learn and  build your own financial plan

It's not rocket science!

Swetha and her cousin Megha earned about the same and lived in the same city

But their money choices? 

Very different

---

Megha followed finance influencers religiously

“Buy a house by 30”, “Invest 50% of your income”, “Retire early!”

She tried to copy everything

---

Swetha? She took a different route

She sat down, listed her goals — her daughter’s education, parents' support, some travel, and a peaceful life

That became her plan

---

Years later, Megha was stressed

Her house EMIs were high, she couldn’t travel, and her savings were all over the place

Swetha, though? 

Calm!

On track. Her plan worked for her

---

No shade to Megha

She just followed what sounded right

But money isn’t one-size-fits-all

It’s personal. Literally

---

Your life, your family, your goals — only you know them best

So build your plan around that

Finance isn’t rocket science

Just make it yours. 🧠💰
