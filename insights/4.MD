Simple interest is interest on your initial money

Compound interest is interest on your interest!

It's what makes your money work for you, creating a powerful snowball effect

Always aim for compounding

---

Aarav and Ramesh both opened savings accounts

Aarav’s choose 6% simple interest

Ramesh chose one that offered 6% compound interest

---

After 5 years,

Aarav had earned a steady return — same amount every year

Ramesh, on the other hand, 

saw his returns grow each year, even though the rate was the same

---

“How’s that even possible?” Aarav asked.

Ramesh showed him the difference:

Simple interest = return on your initial money

Compound interest = return on your initial + previous returns

---

Basically, 

Compounding is like a snowball rolling downhill

It gets bigger and faster with time

As long as you don’t disturb it

---

That’s the power of interest-on-interest

Your money starts working for you

Not just once, but again and again

---

So if you’re investing for the long run

Always aim for compounding

Start early

Stay consistent

And let the snowball grow ❄️➡️💰
