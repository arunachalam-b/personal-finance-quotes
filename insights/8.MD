Someone promises you ₹1 Lakh in 5 years

What's that worth today? 

You have to 'discount' it back to its 'Present Value'

This helps you compare future money with today's money

And make better choices

Vikram’s cousin offered him a deal

“I’ll give you ₹1 Lakh… but 5 years from now.”

Sounded cool

But Vikram wasn’t sure

“Is that a good deal?”

---

He asked his friend Reema, who’s into finance

She said, “Depends. What’s it worth today?”

Vikram blinked

“I just told you — ₹1 Lakh.”

---

Reema smiled

“Yeah

But 5 years from now

If you had that money today, you could invest it and grow it

So future money isn’t the same as today’s money.”

---

She introduced him to the idea of Present Value

How much future money is worth right now

Once you “discount” it based on time and possible returns

---

Turns out

That ₹1 Lakh in 5 years might only be worth around ₹78K today

Obviously, it depends on the return rate

So now Vikram could actually compare it with other options

---

Whenever someone offers you money in the future

Bring it back to today’s terms

That’s Present Value

And it helps you make smarter calls 💡📉
