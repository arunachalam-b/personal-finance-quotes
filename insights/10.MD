Your monthly expenses today

Won't be the same in 25 years

The biggest party pooper is inflation! 

Your ₹50k today might need to be ₹2L/month at retirement

Just to buy the same stuff

Plan for it!

Raj and his dad were chatting over chai

Raj said

“I think I’ll need around ₹50K/month to live comfortably after I retire.”

His dad just laughed

“Beta, that won’t even cover your groceries in 25 years.”

---

Raj was confused

“But ₹50K is enough now!”

His dad nodded

“Yeah… Now

But remember what petrol cost 20 years ago? 

Or movie tickets? 

That’s inflation.”

---

They sat down and did a quick calculation

If inflation stays around 6-7%

Raj would need nearly ₹2 Lakh/month 

In the future to maintain the same lifestyle

---

That hit hard

Same groceries. Same rent. Same life. 

But 4x the cost

Just because of time

And rising prices

---

It’s not about being pessimistic

It’s just reality

Your future expenses won’t look like today’s

And ignoring that is where most people go wrong with retirement planning

---

So while you’re planning your future

Don’t forget the invisible guest — inflation

It quietly eats into your money over time

Plan with that in mind 🧾🔥
