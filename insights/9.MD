Money today is more valuable than money tomorrow

When given a choice

Taking the money now and investing it

Even in a simple FD

Will almost always beat 

Taking the same amount later

A few months ago

Asha’s cousin said


“I can return your ₹20,000 now

or 

₹20,000 exactly one year later

Your call.”

Asha thought

“Same amount either way… 

I can wait.”

---

She mentioned this to her friend Ravi

He said

“Wait… 

Why not take it now 

And 

Just put it in an FD or something?”

That made her pause

---

Out of curiosity

Asha checked

If she took ₹20,000 today 

And 

Put it in a basic FD at ~6%

She’d have ₹21,200 by next year

---

Suddenly

That same ₹20K a year later 

Didn’t feel so equal anymore

It was actually less valuable 

Than what she could do with the money today

---

This is why 

Money today is more powerful

Even if you don’t invest aggressively

Time gives it a chance to grow

---

So next time someone offers you money

Now vs later

Remember

Even a simple FD 

Can turn “now” into more later

Choose smart 💰⏳
