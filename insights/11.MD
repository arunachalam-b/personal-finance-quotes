Thinking about your retirement corpus? 

Don't just multiply your annual expenses by the number of years

You have to calculate the 'Future Value' of your expenses

Accounting for inflation each year

Nikhil decided to get serious about retirement

He told his wife

“We spend ₹6L a year now

I’ll just multiply that by 30 years

So we need ₹1.8 Cr. 

Simple

Right?”

---

She raised an eyebrow

“You’re assuming ₹6L will still cover everything 20 years from now?”

He paused

“Well… yeah?”

---

They did some digging together 

And found out:

Thanks to inflation

₹6L today might become ₹20L/year by the time he actually retires

---

That was his lightbulb moment

Just multiplying expenses by the number of years won’t cut it

You have to factor in how those expenses will grow over time

---

That’s what Future Value helps you figure out

How much today’s expenses will cost in tomorrow’s money

---

So 

If you’re planning your retirement corpus

Don’t just think in today’s numbers

Inflation’s real

Do the math

Or 

It’ll sneak up on you later 📈🧮
