Think  compounding is just a math term? 

The sister who invested early but less ended up with WAY more than the sister who invested more but started late

Time is your greatest asset in investing

---

Two sisters — Neha and Anu

Neha started investing ₹1,000/month from age 22

Anu was busy with other things and began only at 30, but she invested ₹3,000/month

---

By 45, they both paused to check where things stood

Who do you think would have lead the game now?

---

No. You're wrong if you've said Anu

Surprisingly, Neha’s investments had grown more — even though she put in less money overall

---

Anu was confused, “I’ve been investing more than you every month!”

Neha smiled, “Yeah, but I gave it time ⏲️. That’s the secret.”

---

Compounding isn’t about how much

It’s about how long

Time quietly does the heavy lifting — if you just start and stay consistent

---

So if you’re waiting for the ‘right moment’ or a big income jump to begin.... 

Don’t

Just start!

Even with a little

The earlier, the better. 📈⏲️
