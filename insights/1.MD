The best time to start investing was yesterday. 

The second best time is today. 

Don't wait for a 'sizable amount'. 

Even small, regular savings work magic over time thanks to compounding. 

Just start!

Ravi and Arjun were close friends. Both wanted to start investing. 

But Ravi said, “Let me wait until I save a decent amount.” 

Arjun said, “I’ll just start with ₹500 a month.”

---

Years passed. Life got busy. 

Ravi kept pushing it off — “Next month for sure.” 

Arjun? He just kept investing that small amount quietly every month.

---

10 years later, they sat down and checked their numbers. 

Ravi had finally started investing 3 years ago with ₹5,000/month. 

Arjun had been doing ₹500/month from the start.

---

Surprisingly, 

Arjun’s money had grown more — not because he invested more, but because he gave time for compounding to work its magic.

---

Ravi was shocked. 

“All these years I was waiting to invest big. Should’ve just started small like you.” 

Arjun smiled, “It’s okay. The second best time is now.”

---

Don’t wait to have a ‘sizable amount’. 

Even small amounts can grow into something big — if you give it time. 

Just start. 🌱
