Made 50% on an investment? 

Sounds great! 

But over how long? 

For investments >1 year

Use CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) to see your true yearly growth

It's the real report card

---

Rohit met his friend Karan after a few years

Karan said, “Bro, I made 50% returns on my investment!”

Rohit was impressed. “Wow, in how much time?”

Karan: “In 5 years.”

---

Rohit paused

“Wait… 50% over 5 years? That’s like… 10% a year?”

Karan shrugged

“I don’t know. But 50% sounds nice, no?”

---

Here’s the thing

Total return sounds flashy

But it doesn’t show how efficiently your money grew every year

---

That’s where CAGR comes in

Compounded Annual Growth Rate = the actual yearly growth rate, factoring in compounding

It’s your investment’s true “speed.”

---

In Karan’s case

That 50% over 5 years is roughly 8.4% CAGR

Not bad

But not as dramatic as “50%!” makes it sound

---

So next time someone says

“I made 80% returns,” 

Pause and ask:

“Over how long?”

Because CAGR is the real report card. 🧮📊
