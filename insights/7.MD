A rupee today is worth more than a rupee tomorrow

Why? 

Because you can invest today's rupee and make it grow

This is the 'Time Value of Money'

A core concept for all smart financial planning

Last year

Priya’s dad gave her ₹10,000

He said “Use this however you want — or invest it.”

She spent it on a short trip

No regrets

But it was gone

---

Her friend Ritu got the same amount from her uncle

Ritu just parked it in a simple mutual fund

Forgot about it

---

Fast forward to this year

Ritu’s money is now ₹10,800

Not a huge jump

But it grew

Meanwhile Priya? 

Had ₹0 from that trip fund

---

That’s when Priya heard this line:

“A rupee today is worth more than a rupee tomorrow.”

And it clicked

---

It’s not just about saving

It’s about knowing

That today’s money has potential

To grow

To earn

To multiply

---

That’s the Time Value of Money

The earlier you put it to work

The more time it gets to grow

And in money

Time is more powerful than timing ⏳💸
